# Staking & Governance

Spreadly's governance architecture operates across two complementary layers: the Spreadly DAO and Investment DAOs. 
The Spreadly DAO oversees platform-wide operations and protocol parameters, with staked token holders earning 
protocol revenues while guiding the platform's development, while Investment DAOs focus on specific trading strategies 
and treasury management, with their token stakers earning returns from investment activities. Both governance layers 
feature non-locking staking mechanisms, allowing stakers to adjust their positions freely by staking or unstaking at any time.

To participate in governance and revenue sharing, tokens must be staked before specific timeframes - the end of 
the profit distribution epoch for revenue sharing, and before a proposal's voting period concludes for governance 
participation. Token stakers can also delegate their voting power to multiple addresses on Sui, providing flexible 
participation options while managing their involvement across the ecosystem.

## Spreadly DAO

SpreadlyDAO functions as the platform's administrative layer, with staked SPRD holders participating 
in protocol governance and earning revenue from platform activities. Unlike Investment DAOs, 
SpreadlyDAO does not engage in direct trading but instead manages protocol parameters and earns fees from platform usage.

**Protocol Governance -** Staked SPRD holders can participate in governance decisions regarding the following:
  - Setting minimum SPRD thresholds for launching new bonding curves
  - Approving whitelisted assets for the investor window phase of capital formation
  - Determining required SPRD fees for position opening/closing and commenting on proposals
  - Configuring treasury/revenue distribution ratio for total revenues
  - Updating profit distribution schedules and epoch lengths
  - Curating whitelisted assets for DeepBook and Cetus trading
  - Setting management fee rates charged to DAOs on profitable trades
  - Configuring governance parameters including proposal support thresholds, minimum participation requirements, 
  minimum proposal durations, and minimum SPRD stake for proposal creation
  - Overseeing treasury funds for decentralized operation of Spreadly


**Economic Benefits -** Staked SPRD holders earn protocol revenue through two distinct channels:
    * **SPRD Protocol Fees:** SPRD generated from DAO activities across the platform, including DAO launch fees, proposal commenting 
    fees, and trade opening/closing fees.
    - **DAO Trading Fees:** Management fees from profitable trades executed by DAOs, denominated in the traded currency.

Both revenue streams are distributed between treasury and revenue pools according to the DAO config. 
Staked SPRD holders receive their share of the revenue pools through regular epoch-based distributions, 
proportional to their staked amount.

## Investment DAOs

Investment DAOs represent individual trading entities on the platform, each with its own governance structure
and profit distribution mechanism.

**Governance Rights -** Token stakers in Investment DAOs can participate in:
  - Treasury disbandment voting with 30-day cooldown period, requiring a majority vote of all token holders. 
  - Revenue allocation decisions between distribution and reinvestment into the treasury
  - Updating profit distribution schedules and epoch lengths
  - Altering the trader fee that the executing admin receives on profitable trades (only for admin DAOs)
  - Configuring governance parameters including proposal support thresholds, minimum participation requirements, 
  minimum proposal durations, and minimum SPRD stake for proposal creation

**Economic Benefits -** Investment DAO token stakers can earn returns through:
  - Equitable profit distribution from successful trades
  - Proportional treasury share upon DAO disbandment

  **Governance-Based Trading** 
  
  Governance-Based DAOs require proposals for all trading activities and treasury management. DAO token stakers can vote on proposals that:

  - Spot trade any token pairs on DeepBook and Cetus DEX, accessing all tokens on Sui
  - Generate leveraged returns through perpetual futures positions on Sudo Finance
  - Optimize treasury yields by participating in Suilend's lending and borrowing markets
  - Transfer treasury assets to external wallets for specific use cases
  - Build NFT positions by acquiring digital collectibles through TradePort's marketplace
