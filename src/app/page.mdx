# What is Spreadly?

Spreadly is a decentralized asset management protocol that enables anyone to create or join investment 
DAOs on Sui. The platform revolutionizes how decentralized investment vehicles are formed 
and operated by combining structured capital formation with flexible governance models. Through Spreadly, 
users can participate in professionally managed investment strategies or create their own DAOs with customized management structures.

At its core, Spreadly implements a unique two-phase capital formation process that balances community 
participation with capital investment. The first phase utilizes a bonding curve mechanism for price discovery 
and initial token distribution using SPRD tokens, while the second phase opens a multi-asset deposit window 
for larger investors. This structured approach ensures fair access while maintaining economic alignment between all participants.

The protocol supports three distinct management structures - Single Admin, Multi-Admin, and Governance Based - 
each designed to accommodate different operational needs. Single Admin provides streamlined control for 
individual portfolio managers, Multi-Admin enables collaborative investment teams to share responsibilities, 
and Governance Based allows for fully decentralized community management. Each structure maintains robust 
treasury operations through secure DeFi integrations, while incorporating governance mechanisms that protect token holders.

Spreadly's economic model is built around the SPRD token, which serves as both a governance tool and a claim on 
protocol revenues. SPRD holders can stake their tokens to participate in platform governance and earn returns from protocol activities, 
including DAO creation fees, trading fees, and management fees from successful trades. This dual-purpose token model creates strong 
alignment between the protocol's growth and stakeholder returns, while ensuring sustainable development of the platform ecosystem.
