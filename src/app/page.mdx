# What is Spreadly?

Spreadly revolutionizes decentralized asset management by combining structured capital formation with flexible DAO governance. 
The protocol enables anyone to create or join investment DAOs that can autonomously trade, lend, and manage digital assets across the Sui ecosystem. 
Through a unique two-phase capital formation process to form DAOs, Spreadly balances community participation with capital investment by 
utilizing a bonding curve and multi-asset deposits window. Governance and revenue sharing mechanisms align economic incentives, 
with each DAO's management structure controlling investment decisions while distributing protocol fees to the Spreadly community.

## Management Structures

Spreadly empowers organizations with flexible management options through purpose-built contracts that cater to different operational needs:

**Single Admin -** A streamlined structure perfect for individual portfolio managers, featuring:
- Full treasury control through a single wallet address
- Seamless trade execution with automated fee collection
- Fair profit sharing between the trading admin and DAO token stakers
- Emergency disbandment voting, ensuring DAO token stakers can recover equitable shares of the treasury

**Multi-Admin -** Designed for collaborative investment teams that need shared control:
- Equal trading privileges across multiple admin addresses
- Automated fee distribution to trade executors
- Equitable profit sharing with DAO token stakers
- Protected by emergency voting and distribution, just as Single Admin DAOs

**Governance Based -** A fully decentralized model built for community-driven management:
- Democratic control through token-based voting
- Comprehensive proposal system for DAO settings and trades
- Flexible voting power delegation to any address on Sui
- Transparent profit distribution to all token stakers
- Community-controlled emergency procedures for treasury protection

## Key Protocol Components

### Capital Formation Process

The capital formation process uniquely prioritizes community participation before opening to larger investors. 
By making DAO tokens initially available through a bonding curve, the protocol enables community members to acquire 
ownership of the DAO at discovery prices using SPRD. 

The ratio between bonding curve and investor allocations, 
set during DAO creation, determines how many tokens are available in each phase - for example, a 40/60 ratio would make 
40% of tokens available through the SPRD bonding curve and 60% during the asset deposit window.

#### Phase 1 - Bonding Curve
- Initiates and configures a DAO, collects the launch fee in SPRD tokens, then adds the DAO to the bonding curve
- Price discovery through active trading on the bonding curve, with all transactions conducted in SPRD
- Progresses to the investor window phase once the DAO reaches the target SPRD threshold on the curve
- Transitions to the active market trading through automatic liquidity provision on Cetus DEX

#### Phase 2 - Investor Window
- Accepts whitelisted assets during a fixed window (minimum of 24 hours) configured at DAO creation
- Converts all deposits to SUI equivalent using real-time Cetus pool pricing mechanism
- Calculates final token allocation based on relative SUI value contribution
- Distributes tokens according to the predefined investor allocation ratio and individual contribution

### Treasury Operations

DAOs created through Spreadly function as autonomous investment vehicles within the Sui ecosystem, interacting directly 
with DeFi protocols through secure on-chain integrations. Each DAO's treasury can engage with multiple DeFi 
primitives including spot trading, perpetual futures, lending/borrowing, option-based strategies, and NFT trading, 
with capabilities determined by the selected management structure.

Admin DAOs follow a permissioned model focused on core DeFi activities, while Governance DAOs can access the full range 
of treasury operations through community-driven proposals. This tiered access model balances trading flexibility with 
robust treasury security.

Admin DAOs are restricted from NFT trading and external transfers to prevent potential misuse of treasury funds. 
These operations require token holder consensus through the governance proposal system, ensuring community oversight 
of higher-risk treasury activities.

### Staking & Governance

Spreadly's governance architecture operates across two complementary layers: the Spreadly DAO and Investment DAOs. 
The Spreadly DAO oversees platform-wide operations and protocol parameters, with staked token holders earning 
protocol revenues while guiding the platform's development, while Investment DAOs focus on specific trading strategies 
and treasury management, with their token stakers earning returns from investment activities. Both governance layers 
feature non-locking staking mechanisms, allowing stakers to adjust their positions freely by staking or unstaking at any time.

To participate in governance and revenue sharing, tokens must be staked before specific timeframes - the end of 
the profit distribution epoch for revenue sharing, and before a proposal's voting period concludes for governance 
participation. Token stakers can also delegate their voting power to multiple addresses on Sui, providing flexible 
participation options while managing their involvement across the ecosystem.

#### Spreadly DAO

SpreadlyDAO functions as the platform's administrative layer, with staked SPRD holders participating 
in protocol governance and earning revenue from platform activities. Unlike Investment DAOs, 
SpreadlyDAO does not engage in direct trading but instead manages protocol parameters and earns fees from platform usage.

**Protocol Governance -** Staked SPRD holders can participate in governance decisions regarding the following:
  - Setting minimum SPRD thresholds for launching new bonding curves
  - Approving whitelisted assets for the investor window phase of capital formation
  - Determining required SPRD fees for trade execution and proposal comments
  - Configuring treasury/revenue distribution ratio for total revenues
  - Updating profit distribution schedules and epoch lengths
  - Curating whitelisted assets for DeepBook and Cetus trading
  - Setting management fee rates charged to DAOs on profitable trades
  - Configuring governance parameters including proposal support thresholds, minimum participation requirements, 
  minimum proposal durations, and minimum SPRD stake for proposal creation
  - Overseeing treasury funds for decentralized operation of Spreadly


**Economic Benefits -** Staked SPRD holders earn protocol revenue through two distinct channels:
    * **SPRD Protocol Fees:** SPRD generated from DAO activities across the platform, including DAO launch fees, proposal commenting 
    fees, trade execution fees.
    - **DAO Trading Fees:** Management fees from profitable trades executed by DAOs, denominated in the traded currency.

Both revenue streams are distributed between treasury and revenue pools according to the DAO config. 
Staked SPRD holders receive their share of the revenue pools through regular epoch-based distributions, 
proportional to their staked amount.

#### Investment DAOs

Investment DAOs represent individual trading entities on the platform, each with its own governance structure
and profit distribution mechanism.

**Governance Rights -** Token stakers in Investment DAOs can participate in:
  - Treasury disbandment voting with 30-day cooldown period, requiring a majority vote of all token holders. 
  - Revenue allocation decisions between distribution and reinvestment into the treasury
  - Updating profit distribution schedules and epoch lengths
  - Configuring governance parameters including proposal support thresholds, minimum participation requirements, 
  minimum proposal durations, and minimum SPRD stake for proposal creation

**Economic Benefits -** Investment DAO token stakers can earn returns through:
  - Equitable profit distribution from successful trades
  - Proportional treasury share upon DAO disbandment

  **Governance-Based Trading** 
  
  Governance-Based DAOs require proposals for all trading activities and treasury management. DAO token stakers can vote on proposals that:

  - Spot trade any token pairs on DeepBook and Cetus DEX, accessing all tokens on Sui
  - Generate leveraged returns through perpetual futures positions on Sudo Finance
  - Optimize treasury yields by participating in Suilend's lending and borrowing markets
  - Transfer treasury assets to external wallets for specific use cases
  - Build NFT positions by acquiring digital collectibles through TradePort's marketplace
