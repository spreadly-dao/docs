- Comprehensive profit-sharing mechanisms
- Advanced treasury management tools
- Transparent operation logging
- Automated fee distribution systems

## Key Concepts

### Capital Raising Process

Our platform implements a unique two-phase capital raising process:

**1. SPRD Bonding Phase**

The initial phase of capital raising utilizes a standardized mechanism:

- Utilizes a standardized bonding curve mechanism
- Requires a fixed SPRD amount for participation
- Automatically creates liquidity pools upon completion

**2. Asset Deposit Phase (Optional)**

The secondary phase allows for diverse asset inclusion:

- Time-limited deposit window
- Supports multiple pre-approved assets
- Oracle-based asset valuation
- Automated token distribution

### Revenue Distribution

The platform incorporates multiple revenue streams and distribution mechanisms:

**Spreadly DAO Management Fees**

Platform-level revenue management:

- Centralized revenue pool collection
- Staking-based distribution system
- Epoch-based reward calculations

**Individual DAO Profits**

DAO-specific profit handling:

- Dedicated staking contracts per DAO
- Flexible reward periods
- Performance-based distribution
- Transparent fee structures

### Governance

The platform implements a two-tiered governance structure:

**Platform-Level (Spreadly DAO)**

Overarching protocol governance:

- Asset whitelisting decisions for trading and deposits
- Protocol parameter adjustments (SPRD requirements, epoch periods)
- Revenue distribution configurations
- Platform-wide policy changes

**DAO-Level Governance**

Specialized governance based on DAO type:

**Single & Multi-Admin DAOs**

- Treasury disbandment voting (requires majority approval)
- 30-day cooldown period after successful disbandment vote
- Token burning mechanism for treasury share distribution

**Governance-Based DAOs (Upcoming)**

- Full treasury management decisions
- Investment strategy implementation
- Proposal creation and voting
- Configuration changes
