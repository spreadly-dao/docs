# Revenue Distribution

Spreadly implements a dual-stream revenue model that distributes both protocol-level fees and DAO-specific management fees to SPRD token staker. 
The system ensures fair distribution of platform revenues while incentivizing long-term participation in both the Spreadly protocol and individual DAOs.

## Spreadly DAO Streams

The Spreadly protocol generates revenue through two complementary fee sources, which are distributed to protocol stakeholders through a systematic process.

**SPRD Protocol Fees**
- DAO launch fees for creating new investment DAOs
- Proposal commenting fees
- Trade execution fees
   
**DAO Trading Fees**
- Management fees collected from profitable trades
- Denominated in the traded currency

**Distribution Process**

The revenue distribution process begins with a fundamental split of total revenue 
between treasury and distribution pools, with the ratio determined by governance decisions. 
From the distribution pool, rewards are allocated to SPRD stakers on a pro-rata basis according 
to their individual staked amounts. These distributions occur in 30-day epochs, though this 
duration can be modified through governance proposals. To participate in a given epoch's 
distribution, users must have their tokens staked before the epoch concludes to be considered 
eligible for rewards.

## Investment DAO Streams

Investment DAOs implement performance-based reward systems only for profitable trades and investments.

**Distribution Process**

The revenue management process allows for a flexible allocation between distribution and treasury reinvestment, with the specific ratio 
determined through governance decisions. When distributed, rewards are allocated pro-rata to participants based on their 
individual staked token amounts. The distribution follows an epoch-based schedule that can be adjusted through governance 
mechanisms as needed. Once calculated, eligible stakers can claim their portion of the distributed rewards.
