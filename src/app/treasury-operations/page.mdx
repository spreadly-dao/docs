### Treasury Operations

DAOs created through Spreadly function as autonomous investment vehicles within the Sui ecosystem, interacting directly 
with DeFi protocols through secure on-chain integrations. Each DAO's treasury can engage with multiple DeFi 
primitives including spot trading, perpetual futures, lending/borrowing, option-based strategies, and NFT trading, 
with capabilities determined by the selected management structure.

Admin DAOs follow a permissioned model focused on core DeFi activities, while Governance DAOs can access the full range 
of treasury operations through community-driven proposals. This tiered access model balances trading flexibility with 
robust treasury security.

Admin DAOs are restricted from NFT trading and external transfers to prevent potential misuse of treasury funds. 
These operations require token holder consensus through the governance proposal system, ensuring community oversight 
of higher-risk treasury activities.
